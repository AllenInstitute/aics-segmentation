# Apply Classic Image Segmentation Workflow on Your Own Data (using Jupyter Notebook)

Our goal is you may checkout the lookup table first and find the structure with most similar morphology as the objects in your data. For example, you are also working on the segmentation of some "point-source" structure (i.e., spots-like shapes). You may go to DSP.ipynb to (1) test your data with the algorithm and parameters optimized on our data, (2) follow the instruction coded inside the notebook to tweak the parameters so that it works can also work well on your data.

=============


More contents are coming. 

Right now, you may use ./lookup_table_demo/DSP.ipynb to get some sense of what is inside each notebook.
